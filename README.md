# instant-point-drawings
This program basically takes an image an makes it out of points or lines, depending on your settings. (L It can take any resolution image (though works better on smaller images), any background (except transparent), and any format Processing can handle. Once finished with making the drawing, it will export some code to a folder named "InstantPointDrawings". Inside that folder, once you run the code, it will make the image you chose and export it with either a random name or incremental (note incremental may overwrite images, so it is off by default).
